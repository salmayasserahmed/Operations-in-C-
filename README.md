<h2> Beginner Level</h2> 
Write a C program to act as simple calculator, first it will ask the user to enter the operation ID,
depending on the operation, the program will ask the user either to enter 1 operand or 2 operands and
the program will execute the operation and print the result. Each operation should be implemented in a
stand alone function. (Separate the code into files)
